# Hydrogen Firmware

Hydrogen is a fork of the [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) project.

Hydrogen is a highly configurable, advanced 3D printer firmware.

The goal of the Hydrogen project is to bring stability to the Klipper environment,
and foster a healthy development community.

This project will continue to maintain the functionality of Klipper for the forseeable future. Bug reports and pull requests will be accepted here on the GitHub.  
Eventually, the core engine on the SBC will be retired, in favor of [Helium](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Helium), and the two projects shall merge.
