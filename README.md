# Hydrogen Firmware

Hydrogen is a fork of the [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) project.

Hydrogen is a highly configurable, advanced 3D printer firmware.

The goal of the Hydrogen project is to bring stability to the Klipper environment,
and foster a healthy development community. For a detailed look into the goals, please read the [announcement post](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Hydrogen/discussions/1).

This project will continue to maintain the functionality of Klipper for the forseeable future. Bug reports and pull requests will be accepted here on the GitHub.

Eventually, this project will be retired in favor of [Helium](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Helium), when it becomes stable.

Hydrogen is released under the [GPLv3 license](LICENSE.md).
