Hydrogen is a fork of the [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) project.

Hydrogen is a highly configurable, advanced 3D printer firmware.

A general purpose computer, typically a single board computer (SBC), acts as the primary controller. 
This is combined with one or more micro-controllers that work in tandem to drive the printer.

This project will continue to maintain the functionality of Klipper for the forseeable future. Bug reports and pull requests will be accepted over on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Hydrogen) repository.

Eventually, this project will be retired in favor of [Helium](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Helium), when it becomes stable.

To begin using Hydrogen start by [installing](Installation.md) it.

Hydrogen is released under the [GPLv3 license](LICENSE.md).
