## I have a question about Hydrogen

Consult the [Hydrogen documentation](Overview.md) first, before submitting any questions to the [Q&A discussion board](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Hydrogen/discussions/categories/q-a).

It is possible that your question has already been answered there, so please read through the board before asking.

If you have a general question, or are experiencing general printing problems, then also consider a general 3D printing forum.

## I would like to participate in development

There is the [Development Board](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Hydrogen/discussions/categories/development) on GitHub.
If you are starting to write code and would like to talk about it, then this is the place.

When your code is ready for peer review, then we will gladly accept a [pull request](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Hydrogen/pulls).

## Help, it doesn't work!

If you are experiencing problems, we recommend you carefully read the
[Hydrogen documentation](Overview.md) and double check that all steps
were followed.

If you are experiencing a printing problem, then we recommend
carefully inspecting the printer hardware (all joints, wires, screws,
etc.) and verify nothing is abnormal. If you do find a problem with
the printer hardware then consider searching general 3D printing
forums, or forums dedicated to the printer hardware.

## I have found a bug

Bug reports should be submitted to the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Hydrogen/issues). Please follow the submission guide, as it will help us resolve the problem quicker.

## I have a feature request

Features need someone to take initiative in order to bring them to life.
If you have a proposal and feel ready to take it further, please post it within the [Ideas discussion board](https://github.com/Chaos-3D/Hydrogen/discussions/categories/ideas).

Be sure to check that nobody else has already had the same idea before submitting.
